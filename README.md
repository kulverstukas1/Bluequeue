Bluequeue

Ever wanted to send 10, 20 maybe 30 pictures to your friend but didn't bother to do so because sending them one by one is frustrating?

Bluequeue is a multiple file sender via bluetooth. With simple interface, simple controls and integrated file browser.
It can send files to dumbphones (old Nokia's for ex.) as well as to smartphones and computers.

It does not need for devices to be paired for file exchange.

Get it from GPlay: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kulver.blueque
